                    We will review your designs (website or mobile/web app) and explore where the design works well and
                    where it can be improved. We focus our process around one central question: “What can we do to make
                    this design more efficient?”

                    <p class="fontTheinhardt">Unlike any other design review or audit, we will not only tell you what
                        can be improved but also
                        make revamps to the most critical parts of the design.</p>
                    <h5>Design Report</h5>
                    <p class="fontTheinhardt">We will evaluate your design based on a variety of parameters and provide
                        a detailed visual report
                        with useful tips and design hacks. This would be the starting point for further work on the
                        design.</p>
                    <h5>Ways to Redesign</h5>
                    <p class="fontTheinhardt">We provide several strategies for further redesign by various contractors,
                        from freelancers to
                        high-end agencies. We provide you with an assessment of the timing and cost for both a full
                        redesign and quick but effective improvements.</p>
